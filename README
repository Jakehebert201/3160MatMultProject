As of now, this is a project encompassing one of three required programming languages to compute matrix multiplications.

The first program is done in C using the CUDA libraries to utilize the GPU in matrix calculations- This satisfies the compiled languge requirement of the MatMult project.
The program uses NVIDIA's Matrix Multiplication sample as a base to ensure that the GPU is utilized to its fullest
